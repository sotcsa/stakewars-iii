## Transactions Guide
### Deposit and Stake NEAR

Command:
```
near call ${POOL_ID} deposit_and_stake --amount <amount> --accountId ${ACCOUNT_ID} --gas=300000000000000
```
### Unstake NEAR
Amount in yoctoNEAR.

Run the following command to unstake:
```
near call ${POOL_ID} unstake '{"amount": "<amount yoctoNEAR>"}' --accountId ${ACCOUNT_ID} --gas=300000000000000
```
To unstake all you can run this one:
```
near call ${POOL_ID} unstake_all --accountId ${ACCOUNT_ID} --gas=300000000000000
```
### Withdraw

Unstaking takes 2-3 epochs to complete, after that period you can withdraw in YoctoNEAR from pool.

Command:
```
near call ${POOL_ID} withdraw '{"amount": "<amount yoctoNEAR>"}' --accountId ${ACCOUNT_ID} --gas=300000000000000
```
Command to withdraw all:
```
near call ${POOL_ID} withdraw_all --accountId ${ACCOUNT_ID} --gas=300000000000000
```

### Ping
A ping issues a new proposal and updates the staking balances for your delegators. A ping should be issued each epoch to keep reported rewards current.
